[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/py-algorand-sdk/badge/?version=latest&style=flat)](https://py-algorand-sdk.readthedocs.io/en/latest)
[![Code style: black](https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-black-000000.svg)](https://github.com/psf/black)

A python library for interacting with the Algorand network.

## Installation

Run `pip3 install algosdk` to install the package.


## Supported Python versions

algorand sdk's minimum Python version policy attempts to balance several constraints.

* Make it easy for the community to use algorand sdk by minimizing or excluding the need to customize Python installations.
* Provide maintainers with access to newer language features that produce more robust software.

Given these constraints, the minimum Python version policy is:
Target Python version on newest [Ubuntu LTS](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Releases) released >= 6 months ago.

The rationale is:

* If a major Linux OS distribution bumps a Python version, then it's sufficiently available to the community for us to upgrade.
* The 6 month time buffer ensures we delay upgrades until the community starts using a recently released LTS version.

## Quick start

Here's a simple example you can run without a node.

```python
from algosdk import account, encoding

# generate an account
private_key, address = account.generate_account()
print("Private key:", private_key)
print("Address:", address)

# check if the address is valid
if encoding.is_valid_address(address):
    print("The address is valid!")
else:
    print("The address is invalid.")
```

## Node setup

Follow the instructions in Algorand's [developer resources](https://developer.algorand.org/docs/run-a-node/setup/install/) to install a node on your computer.
You can also set up a local [Algorand Sandbox](https://github.com/algorand/sandbox) with `make harness`.

## Running examples/example.py

Before running [example.py](https://github.com/algorand/py-algorand-sdk/blob/master/examples/example.py), start kmd on a private network or testnet node:

```bash
./goal kmd start -d [data directory]
```

Next, create a wallet and an account:

```bash
./goal wallet new [wallet name] -d [data directory]
```

```bash
./goal account new -d [data directory] -w [wallet name]
```

Visit the [Algorand dispenser](https://bank.testnet.algorand.network/) and enter the account address to fund your account.

Next, in [tokens.py](https://github.com/algorand/py-algorand-sdk/blob/master/examples/tokens.py), either update the tokens and addresses, or provide a path to the data directory. Alternatively, `tokens.py` also defaults to the sandbox harness configurations for algod and kmd, which can be brought up by running `make harness`.

You're now ready to run example.py!
