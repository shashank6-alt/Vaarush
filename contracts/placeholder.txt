Vaarush Contracts Placeholder

This placeholder file explains current features of the inheritance contract MVP and major functionality planned for future updates.

=================
MVP FUNCTIONALITY
=================
- Single owner can create an inheritance contract.
- Single heir (accounts[1]) is registered at creation.
- Asset ID and release time are recorded.
- After the release time passes, only the registered heir can trigger asset withdrawal.
- Asset transfer uses an inner transaction.
- Double-claim is prevented; contract marks assets claimed after first successful claim.

=======================
PLANNED FUTURE UPGRADES
=======================
- Multiple heirs and distributed shares (variable splits of inheritance).
- Support for transferring multiple asset types and varying amounts.
- Off-chain metadata integration (IPFS or Arweave for will text and files).
- Advanced role-based permissions (executor, revoker, auditor roles).
- Allow contract update of release time, heirs, or executor before release.
- Bulk claim/batch transactions for inheriting numerous assets at once.
- Full event logging and notification hooks for external services (email/SMS/webhook).
- Typed client libraries (ARC-32 JSON â†’ Python/JS) for easy integration in web/app projects.
- End-to-end backend API (register heirs, update metadata, monitor contract).
- Unit/integration/fuzz tests for all scenarios. Security battery for auditing.
- On-chain upgrade patterns: DAOs, proxy contracts, and governance features.
